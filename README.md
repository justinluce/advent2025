My Advent Code 2025 solutions.

TFW you don't use AI to write code and instead write it yourself **for fun** despite LinkedInfluencers, startup tech CEOs, and vibe coders passing money to each other and evangelizing about AI increasing profit margins - meanwhile AGI being in a perpetual state of 'right around the corner'.

I am not annoyed. You simply need more joy and whimsy in your lives.
